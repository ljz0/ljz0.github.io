<span style="font-size:20px;">I recently received my PhD in Econometrics and Statistics from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, where I was mentored by [Azeem Shaikh](https://home.uchicago.edu/~amshaikh/) and [Christian Hansen](https://voices.uchicago.edu/christianhansen/) between 2020 and 2024. In Autumn 2024, I joined Amazon as a Postdoctoral Scientist, where I work on panel data methods and machine learning for policy evaluation with [Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ett/).</span>

<span style="font-size:20px;">My research focuses on causal inference and econometrics, with a particular interest in the design and analysis of randomized experiments. </span>

<span style="font-size:20px;">I will be joining Peking University HSBC Business School as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in Fall 2025.</span>

### [Randomization Inference for Two-Sided Market Experiments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06215) (with Azeem Shaikh and Panos Toulis)

> We propose a randomization inference framework to analyze outcomes from two-sided market experiments.

> We develop new methods for causal inference in observational studies on a single large network of interconnected units, addressing two key challenges: long-range dependence among units and the presence of general interference.
