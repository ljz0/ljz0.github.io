<span style="font-size:20px;">I completed my PhD in Econometrics and Statistics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business from 2020 to 2024, where I was advised by [Azeem Shaikh](https://home.uchicago.edu/~amshaikh/) and [Christian Hansen](https://voices.uchicago.edu/christianhansen/). My primary research interests are in causal inference, including the design and analysis of experiments and observational studies.</span>

<span style="font-size:20px;">Starting in Autumn 2024, I joined Amazon as a Postdoctoral Scientist, collaborating with [Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ett/) on challenging causal inference and machine learning problems inspired by real-world applications.</span> 

<span style="font-size:20px;">I am currently on the 2024-2025 academic job market.</span>

## Working Papers

### [Inference for Two-stage Experiments under Covariate-Adaptive Randomization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14nUgdKqKN1JTs696u-SWvhDxtYQ23UZq/view?usp=sharing) (Job Market Paper)

### [Efficient Treatment Effect Estimation in Observational Studies under Heterogeneous Partial Interference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12420.pdf) (with Zhaonan Qu, Ruoxuan Xiong and Guido Imbens)

> We propose a flexible framework for heterogeneous partial interference that partitions units into subsets based on observables. We allow interactions to be heterogeneous across subsets, but homogeneous for individuals within a subset. In this framework, we propose a class of estimators for heterogeneous direct and spillover effects from observational data that are shown to be doubly robust, asymptotically normal, and semiparametric efficient.

### [On the Effi­ciency of Finely Strat­i­fied Exper­i­ments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15181.pdf) (with Yuehao Bai, Azeem Shaikh and Max Tabord-Meehan)

> We study the efficient estimation of a large class of treatment effect parameters that arise in the analysis of experiments.
